Brainstorming for game

Process:
-Write or draw about the problem
-Extract key concepts from 1 and research them
-Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts
-Code the classes and a test to run them
-Repeat and refine

options: Eragon

This will be a game that takes you through Eragon's process for finding a new
haven to teach the new dragon rider generation. He is riding with Saphira to
the east, finding new lands and deciding which place is the best for the
dragons and the best place to be a training area. Eragon encounters different
species of people, including dark elves, mini dragons, and giant trolls.
He has to fight them or make peace with them with treaties, depending on the
people. Eragon will lose if he makes the wrong choice, or if he chooses the
wrong place to settle, dooming the dragon riders.

Scenes with description:

Lose - Eragon makes the wrong decision or doesn't get past the bad guys

Saphira- Eragon is traveling on Saphira's back, going to new places.
          This is the starting point since they are traveling searching
          for new places.

Forest - Saphira and Eragon are searching through forests to find habitable
          places. They go from Saphira (on her back) to walking through the
          forest.

ElvesHome- Eragon encounters the dark elves, which are evil. They try to kill
          him and Saphira, but if they make the right choices, they
          will survive.

GiantTrolls- huge ugly troll monsters that are easily defeated. Eragon and
              Saphira kill them all easily, and encounter them after the elves.

ParadiseLand- a land that seems perfect to raise the dragon riders and dragons.
              but it turns out its too good to be true. All the food available
              is poison, and Eragon almost dies until he realizes its poison.

MiniDragons- Eragon and saphira find a mini dragon sanctuary. Turns out, these
              dragons are a species variation of alagaesia dragons, but still
              able to do magic, but are just smaller. They have vast amounts
              of knowledge of the workings of the dragon line, big or small.
              This is the place Eragon and Saphira should settle once they
              trust the mini dragons and earn the mini dragons trust.
