Phrase Drills -- Python code to English sentences

classX(Y) "Make a class named X that is-a Y"

class X(object):def__init__(self,J) "class X has-a __init__ that takes self and J parameters"

class X(object): def M(self, J) "class X has a function named M that takes self and J parameters"

foo = X() "Set foo to an instance of class X"

foo.M(J) "From foo, get the M function, and call it with parameters self, J"

foo.K = Q "From foo, get the K attribute, and set it to Q."
